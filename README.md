# Cra11y

An open source web a11y crawling tool using [Electron](https://electronjs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), and [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe) built by [Union](https://union.co).

## Concepts

Postman or Insomnia + A11y tooling. This MacOS app is using Create React App and Electron to create a seemless UI to crawl and audit accessibilty rules on an entire websites. It uses [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to be able to run javascript to get the best possible audit results.


### Project
A project contains a name, home url, number of pages to initially crawl and analyze, and some axe related settings.
